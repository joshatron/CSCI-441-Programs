Notes
-----
1. Auto door opening +2
2. Torches +2
3. Out door lighting +2
4. The locking of the mouse didn't work so well for me. I ended up taking it out to be able to test the rest of the program. -2
5. Models +2
6. Textures +2
7. I like that you added flickering to the torches. I'm glad you mentioned it in your README because it was too fast a flicker for me to tell from playing. Generally, this kind of flickering behavior would be controlled with a time varying noise function. Look into perlin noise for an easier way of controlling this behavior. You can easily adjust the magnitude and frequency of the noise and can layer the noise (similar to fractals) to get more detail. +2
