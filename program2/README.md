## Summary

Procedural modeling is a term used in computer graphics to describe methods for
generating geometry using a set of rules rather than using manual modeling techniques. 
Some advanced examples of procedural modeling are L-systems and fractals. High end 
procedural modeling systems are used in animated films and video games to generate 
natural landscapes, forests, cityscapes and more. Modern manufacturing techniques such 
as 3D printing and CNC machining can be used to bring unique procedurally modeled 
products into the real world such as this single stranded knot ball generated by 
Freakin' Sweet Knots:

## Required Materials

Your program2 directory must include:

* All source code for the completed program
* A screenshot of your program displaying your procedurally modeled object
* A README.md file with any necessary instructions for using your program, along with a description of what your procedurally generated object is

## Detailed Requirements

*Your program must*

*Be an original program written by you.* You may use code from labs as a starting point. You may talk with other 
students about the program, but looking at their code is not allowed.

*Implement a virtual trackball.* Use your virtual trackball code from the labs to provide an intuitive interface for 
viewing your model. You are encouraged to include other means of viewing your model, such as a first person control 
or a fly mode.

*Shade your object using diffuse, specular and ambient lighting.* Phong shading is a standard way to preview models 
in any 3D modeling software. Use a light source (or multiple sources) that provide a good visual preview of your model. 
You are encouraged to incorporate other lighting and shading features such as textures, bump mapping, and/or normal mapping.

*Have four configurable options to adjust your model.* If your model is a brick wall, the four options can include brick 
size (width, height and depth), wall dimensions (number of bricks in a row and number of rows of bricks), brick spacing 
(the amount of space between bricks) and wall shape (a single wall, a complete square wall, a circular wall, etc. pick 
at least 2). If you have other ideas for your four options, come talk to me so I can approve them beforehand. If you choose 
something other than a brick wall, you MUST come talk to me about what your four configurable options are so I can approve 
them. I recommend talking to me well before the deadline to make sure your idea qualifies. It is up to you how the user is 
able to adjust your options. Qt sliders are an intuitive way to scrub options, see lab 4 for an example of using QSliders. 
Keyboard and mouse events are also ways you can adjust your options. Be sure to document how to adjust each option in your 
README file.

*A README.md file.* Write up what your program does, and how to use it, along with any extra information you want me to know 
about your program.

*Demonstrate creativity and self expression.* Put effort into your program beyond the minimum requirements. Experiment, 
put extra features in, organize your code exquisitely, itâ€™s really up to you. Explain what you did in your README.md file.
